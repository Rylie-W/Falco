# FALCO

This is the source code of our **Falco** project in 2022 Google Solution Challenge.

Falco is an application using gaming mechanism to help users build good consumption habits and reduce food waste. Itâ€™s built with **Flutter** which combines fun and convenience and presents animations with **Rive**.

We also offer shopping receipts scanning function, which is realized by integrating Google Cloud Vision API with the backend service deployed on Google Cloud Platform. The backend code can be found at [Falco-Server](https://github.com/Rylie-W/falco-server).
